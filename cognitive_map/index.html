                    Imagine teaching someone to navigate through a small maze. They quickly learn basic rules: avoid walls, find shortest paths, reach goals. But what happens when you present them with a much larger, more complex maze? Humans handle this leap with remarkable ease. For language models, however, this kind of extrapolation has been a significant challenge.

        Recent advances in language models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, from natural language understanding to complex reasoning tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond training data remains a significant challenge, particularly in structured problem-solving scenarios like path planning and navigation, even after fine-tuning<sup>[1]</sup>.

      <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">The Human Edge in Problem-Solving</h2>
      <p>
        Humans demonstrate remarkable abilities in generalizing problem-solving strategies across different scales and complexities. This capability stems from our cognitive architecture, which cognitive scientists have long studied and categorized into two primary systems <sup>[2]</sup>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>System 1:</strong> Quick, instinctive responses based on familiar patterns, operating automatically and with little effort</li>
        <li><strong>System 2:</strong> Careful, methodical thinking that creates mental maps of problems, engaging in conscious reasoning and strategic planning</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This dual-process theory has profound implications for AI development, particularly in how we approach the challenge of making language models truly cognitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent approaches, such as Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning<sup>[3]</sup>, show promise for mimicking System 2 reasoning via in-context learning. Theoretical findings
        suggest that complex problems outside the <span> `TC^0 `</span> (polynomial-sized constant-depth circuits) complexity class can be solved with an ample amount of CoT tokens<sup>[4]</sup>. However, the precise form of CoT required remains unclear. <b>Our research is to configure the CoT variant that can show emergent cognitive map-like behavior in language models.</b>
      </p>
      <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">Extrapolation in Gridworld as a Probe of Cognitive Map</h2>
      <p>
        How do we know if the language model exhibits cognitive map-like behavior? We investigate this through extrapolation, a key characteristic of System 2 reasoning. By training a language model with simple demonstrations and testing its extrapolation capabilities in complex environments, we can determine if it possesses cognitive maps. Specifically, we utilize a Gridworld environment for several compelling reasons:
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cognitive science foundations:</strong> Probing
            mental representations through spatial tasks is foundational in cognitive science<sup>[5]</sup></li>
          <li><strong>Minimal knowledge requirements:</strong> Gridworld provides an ideal environment to probe the
            extrapolability of language models while minimizing the influence of world knowledge</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Gridworld allows us to systematically increase
            the problem space by expanding the grid dimensions</li>
          <li><strong>Complexity class and computational limitations:</strong> Gridworld has a complexity class outside <span> `TC^0`</span>, so a fixed-precision transformer can't solve it<sup>[6]</sup></li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
        To measure true extrapolability of language models, we designed a rigorous experimental setup:
      </p>
        
      <div class="key-insight">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Training Environment:</strong> Limited to 10x10 grids maximum</li>
          <li><strong>Testing Environment:</strong> Extended to 20x20 grids maximum</li>
          <li><strong>Key Challenge:</strong> Evaluating extrapolation beyond training distribution</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        Our test set features significantly longer input tokens and higher environmental complexity compared 
        to the training set, allowing us to evaluate true extrapolation capabilities.
      </p>

      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="materials/train_test.png" alt="Training vs Testing Statistics">
          <p class="caption"></p>
        <b>Heatmaps and Statistics of Train/Test set:</b>  Heatmap of (a, b) shows average input token length and complexity for different 
        Gridworld sizes axb. The red box in the test set heatmap indicates the training set boundaries.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        We observe clear differences between training and testing environments in both input length and 
        complexity (measured by the negative log probability of successfully completing an optimal path using a 
        random policy). Our hypothesis is that models equipped with cognitive map-like reasoning should be able 
        to effectively handle test cases outside the training distribution (shown in red box) by leveraging their 
        systematic planning capabilities.

            <b>Two planning scenarios:</b> The difference between optimal planning (single-turn) and reachable planning (multi-turn) approaches in solving navigation tasks.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        We test two types of planning scenarios in Gridworld: optimal planning and reachable planning. Optimal planning involves finding the shortest path to the goal, while reachable planning allows for multiple steps to reach the goal. The key difference lies in the complexity of the planning task and the need for offline planning before actual interaction. Optimal planning requires a comprehensive mental model of the environment, akin to cognitive maps, to find the shortest path efficiently.
      </p>


      <h2 class="title is-3">Cognitive Maps for Path Planning: Planning with World Model through CoT</h2>
      <p>
        The cognitive map framework operates through three integrated stages: sampling, propagation, and backtracking. This architecture enables language models to simultaneously <b>1) build robust world model of novel environments </b> and <b>2) perform model-based planning</b> through CoT reasoning. At the sampling stage, the model extracts key environmental features and relationships. During propagation, it extends these initial observations into a broader cognitive map. The backtracking stage then leverages this representation to identify optimal solutions by evaluating potential paths and their outcomes. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the model's ability to extrapolate beyond its training data, generating effective solutions for previously unseen scenarios without requiring external feedback or interaction.

      <h2 class="title is-3">Experimental Results</h2>
      <p>
        We compared the performance of language models equipped with cognitive maps against baseline models with implicit (directly predicting the next action) and explicit (predicting the next action via conventional CoT) planning capabilities. Here are some key findings:

      <p>
        Our experiments demonstrate that models equipped with cognitive maps only shows significant improvements in extrapolation capabilities, achieving higher success rates in unseen environments and more optimal paths in reachable planning scenarios.

      <h2 class="title is-3">Additional Analysis and Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        Our experiments with cognitive maps in language models for path planning tasks reveal several
intriguing insights that extend beyond extrapolation. Here are some key findings & discussions:
      </p>
      <h3 class="title is-4">Rapid Adaptation During Training</h3>
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="materials/rapid_adaptation.png" alt="Success rate and Loss curves">
          <p class="caption">Success rate and loss curves showing rapid adaptation of cognitive map (Green plot)</p>
          <p>
            The models using cognitive maps demonstrate remarkably quick learning and adaptation to new scenarios. The success rate converges early (79.13% at step 500) and the loss curve shows faster convergence compared to baseline methods.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3 class="title is-4">Unpromptable Nature of Cognitive Maps</h3>
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="materials/unpromptable_nature.png" alt="Prompting Results">
          <p class="caption">Few-shot prompting results across different models and approaches</p>
            <p>
            Advanced language models often struggle to generate meaningful cognitive maps through simple prompting, underscoring the necessity for specialized training methods. Notably, only GPT-o1 demonstrates some success in creating cognitive maps without explicit prompting.
            </p>
            <p>
            This success may be attributed to GPT-o1's training or fine-tuning, which likely enhances its reasoning process, encourages exploration of alternative strategies, and improves its ability to iteratively recognize and correct mistakes. Consequently, GPT-o1 may be more proficient at forming mental representations of spatial relationships, even without explicit prompts for cognitive maps.
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3 class="title is-4">Comparison with Exploration-based Methods</h3>
      <p>
        Apart from offline planning with cognitive maps, there are numerous exploration strategies for language models, including Tree of Thoughts
    (ToT)<sup>[7]</sup>, which combines language model sampling with value estimation for tree
    search. We compared cognitive map approaches with exploration-based methods like DFS (Depth-First Search) where language models explore and traverse the environment iteratively until reaching the goal.
      </p>
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="materials/exploration_comparison.png" alt="Exploration-based Planning Comparison">
          <p class="caption">Performance comparison between cognitive maps and exploration-based planning</p>
          <p>
        While exploration-based methods achieve higher success rates in reachable planning scenarios (94.5% vs 88.5%), cognitive maps demonstrate superior efficiency in path optimality. This can be an analogy to two distinct human planning strategies:
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column">
          <div class="box has-background-light">
        <h3 class="title is-4">Offline Planning</h3>
        <p>Using cognitive maps to plan the entire route before taking the first step - like studying a map before starting a journey.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <div class="box has-background-light">
        <h3 class="title is-4">Online Exploration</h3>
        <p>Exploring and adjusting the route as you go - like using a GPS that recalculates when you take a wrong turn.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Each approach has its own tradeoffs. While offline planning using cognitive maps requires building a robust mental model upfront and can achieve more optimal paths, it demands significant computational resources for comprehensive planning. In contrast, online exploration is more flexible and requires less initial computation, making it easier to implement since it doesn't need a complete world model. However, this comes at the cost of requiring more interactions with the environment and potentially leading to less optimal paths. This mirrors human decision-making, where we sometimes prefer quick, adaptive solutions over carefully planned optimal routes.
