        Hi, I am an MS student studying language models. I am a member of Language & Knowledge Lab at <a href="http://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST AI</a>, advised by <a href="https://seominjoon.github.io/">Minjoon Seo</a>. Before studying language models, I completed my BS in Mathematics & Computer Science(double major) at KAIST.<br>
        
        My primary research objective revolves around developing a generalist decision making AI model. I hypothesize that the model mirrors the cognitive processes through which humans perceive, learn, and navigate their environment. My aim is to identify a processing and learning algorithm that allows AI to implicitly construct a robust world model, leveraging it internally to effectively explore its surroundings and uncover novel insights not explicitly provided during training. As a starting point for the goal, I am currently interested in following topics:<br>

        (1) Interpreting how LLM perceive the world through world model.<br>
        
        (2) Enhancing contemporary transformer structure and training scheme for robust decision making.<br>
        
        (3) Reasoning/planning in compositional, long-horizon tasks(especially in language and robotics domain).<br>
        
        
        I am currently finding for an open PhD position starting from fall 2025. I am also finding for a visiting research/internship position starting from fall 2024/spring 2025.<br>

        Feel free to contact me via email if you have any questions!
