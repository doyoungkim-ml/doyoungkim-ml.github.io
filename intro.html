        Hi, I am an MS student studying LLM. I am a member of Language & Knowledge Lab at <a href="http://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST AI</a>, advised by <a href="https://seominjoon.github.io/">Minjoon Seo</a>. Before studying LLM, I completed my BS in Mathematics & Computer Science(double major) at KAIST.<br>
        
        My primary research objective revolves around developing an effective algorithm for AI to comprehend the world model. I hypothesize that this algorithm might mirror the cognitive processes through which humans perceive, learn, and navigate their environment. My aim is to identify a processing and learning algorithm that allows AI to implicitly construct a robust world model, leveraging it internally to effectively explore its surroundings and uncover novel insights not explicitly provided during training. As a starting point for the goal, I am currently interested in two main areas below:<br>

        (1) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09024">Exploring a better alternative to current NTP supervision for Language Modeling</a><br>

        
        (2) Making LLM a general planner<br>

        I am currently finding for an open PhD position starting from fall 2025. I am also finding for a visiting research/internship position starting from fall 2024/spring 2025.<br>

        Feel free to contact me via email if you have any questions!
